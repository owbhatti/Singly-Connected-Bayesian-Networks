# Singly-Connected-Bayesian-Networks
This project of data structures and algorithms covers the basic implementation of Bayesian Networks, which are in turn the building blocks of automated reasoning systems. This report aims to explore the algorithm for belief propagation in singly connected Bayesian networks.
